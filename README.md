# Development of a Smart Home Ontology and The Implementation of A Semantic Sensor Network Simulator: An Internet of Things Approach

"In this project, we presented the smart home ontology (SHO), we developed and a simulator software for a smart home using
SHO. We constructed our ontology based on the well-known SSN ontology. Basic concepts were covered in our case to keep
the ontology simple. Experiments are performed to test the simulation system. We applied several scenarios to measure
the performance of the applications and ontology.

In our solution, we propose creating a sensor network ontology for smart home automation based on the SSN and
show that it works by using a simulation application program we developed. The ontology is called ”smart home ontology”
(SHO). In the simulation application, systems used at home such as computers, home appliances, security, lighting and
heating devices are modelled separately. Master/slave model is used to implement the simulation. All modelled devices
communicate with each other via using a message queue. The main computer system controls the whole system as a master node where the other systems behave like slaves and
get commands from the master and execute."
